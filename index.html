			<h2> <strong>My professional experiences</strong> :</h2>
			<p>
				Working is essential in life. Even though I'm only 18 years old, I already have experienced some works. On the one hand, I've done several small jobs like baby-sitting, waitress at private parties, and responsible at a polling station during the 2020 municipal elections. On the other end, I worked 4 weeks full-time as an ice cream saleswoman and fund manager at Galeries Layette Gourmet.
